# IoT Data Processing Workflow with AWS IoT Core, Lambda, and S3

This project demonstrates a simple workflow for processing IoT data using Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses AWS IoT Core to collect data from IoT devices, AWS Lambda to process and transform the data, and Amazon S3 to store the processed data for further analysis or archiving.

## Project Structure

- **IoT Devices**: Connect to AWS IoT Core to send data.
- **AWS IoT Core**: Acts as the gateway for IoT devices, securely ingesting data and triggering further actions.
- **AWS Lambda**: Processes incoming IoT data based on predefined rules and executes the desired logic.
- **Amazon S3**: Stores processed data from Lambda for long-term storage and analysis.

## Setup Instructions

1. **AWS Account**: Ensure you have an AWS account. If not, [sign up here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
2. **IoT Devices**: Set up your IoT devices and ensure they can connect to AWS IoT Core. Refer to the [AWS IoT Core documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/) for details.
3. **IoT Core Setup**:
   - Create an IoT Core topic for your devices to publish data.
   - Define rules to trigger AWS Lambda functions upon data ingestion.
4. **Lambda Setup**:
   - Create Lambda functions to process IoT data.
   - Configure triggers from IoT Core based on the rules.
5. **S3 Setup**:
   - Create an S3 bucket for data storage.
   - Configure the Lambda function to store processed data in S3.
6. **IAM Configuration**:
   - Create necessary IAM roles and policies for IoT Core, Lambda, and S3 to ensure secure access.
   - Restrict permissions to only what is necessary for each component.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Once set up, IoT devices send data to IoT Core.
2. **Data Processing**: IoT Core routes incoming data to Lambda functions based on defined rules.
3. **Data Storage**: After processing, Lambda sends data to Amazon S3.
4. **Further Analysis**: The data in S3 can be used for further analysis, machine learning, or other applications.
